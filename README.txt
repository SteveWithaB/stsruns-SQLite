This is a python script to load Slay the Spire run history files, specifically from Baalorlord's run history, into a SQL database. The script is currently designed for SQLite purposes. An empty database is provided and would populate in the first run. By default, the database should be in the same folder as the Python script.
NOTE: On first run there is a single line to un-comment so that a static s_object table gets loaded. It calls a LoadObject function which uses a master data.json file from the Slaytabase project.
